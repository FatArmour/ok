      The Pieces in Chess are (In Order of Least Important to Most Important):
    </h2>
    <h3 class="center">The Pawn</h3>
    <p>
      The pawn is the most basic piece. It is the easiest to develop, and most
      openings begin with moving a pawn forward (eg. e4). It moves one space up
      (can move two the first time it moves), and takes left and right
      diagonally.

    <h3>The Knight</h3>
    <p>
      The knight is a unique piece in the sense that it has the ability to
      "jump" over pieces. The knight moves and captures in an "L" direction.

      only piece other than the pawn that can be developed on the first turn.
